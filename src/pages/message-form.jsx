              an insult at the end. You may also choose to suggest things that
              will help them become a better person as a whole! Future
              predictions are tough, as shown by the available future
              predictions apps just like the love predictions! No one knows what
              is going to happen next. But, it is always good to be aware of
              your cons, focuses on your pros, and transforming your cons to
